## About The Project

Managing student academic records can be a complex and time-consuming task for schools. E-Transcript-App streamlines this entire workflow, offering a robust web-based platform to:

*   **Generate professional-looking student transcripts** and instantly export them as PDF files.
*   **Organize and manage all transcripts** in a centralized, digital hub.
*   Ensure data is never lost with automatic, secure cloud backups (assuming this refers to database backups).
*   Maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive student information through restricted access.

Built using a reliable stack of **procedural PHP** for backend logic, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive frontend, E-Transcript-App offers a robust and easy-to-use system for academic record keeping.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of E-Transcript-App up and running on your server, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your server environment:

*   **PHP:** Version 7.4+ (or your specific required version) with necessary extensions (e.g., `mysqli`, `gd`, `intl`, `mbstring`, `zip`).
*   **Web Server:** Apache or Nginx configured to serve PHP applications.
*   **Database Server:** MySQL or MariaDB.
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chiemela/E-Transcript-App.git
    cd E-Transcript-App
    ```

2.  **Move to your web server's document root:**
    Move the `E-Transcript-App` folder into your web server's public directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/` for Apache on Linux, or `htdocs` for XAMPP/WAMP).
    ```sh
    # Example for Linux/Apache:
    sudo mv E-Transcript-App /var/www/html/
    ```

3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Create a new database for the application (e.g., `e_transcript_db`).
    *   Import the provided SQL schema file into your newly created database. Look for a file named `database.sql` or similar within the cloned repository.
        ```bash
        # Example using MySQL command line:
        mysql -u your_db_user -p e_transcript_db < path/to/E-Transcript-App/database.sql
        # Replace 'path/to/E-Transcript-App/database.sql' with the actual path
        ```

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    *   Locate the database configuration file (e.g., `config.php`, `db_connect.php`, or similar) within the project.
    *   Update the database credentials (hostname, username, password, database name) to match your setup.

5.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where your web server is hosting the application.
    ```
    http://localhost/E-Transcript-App/
    # Or your server's public IP/domain
    ```
